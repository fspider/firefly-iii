Somebody (hopefully you) just created a new Firefly III API OAuth Client for your user account. It's labeled "{{ client.name }}" and has callback URL:

{{ client.redirect }}

With this client, they can access <strong>all</strong> of your financial records through the Firefly III API.

If this wasn't you, please revoke this client as soon as possible at {{ route('profile.index') }}.
