## [4.8.2-alpha.1 (API 0.10.5)] - 2019-11-03

Normally I won't be detailling alpha versions in the changelog but this is a 
special one. If your Firefly III installation warned you that this version has 
been released, please take note that this is a **test** version and may **not** 
be stable!

### Changed
- Firefly III now comes in three channels: stable, beta and alpha. You can 
  find the latest version for each channel on [this website](https://version.firefly-iii.org/).
- To make sure your Docker instance logs everything to `stdout`, make sure 
  you set the environment variable `LOG_CHANNEL` to `docker_out`. This is now 
  default behavior for new installations that use the `.env` file to launch 
  Firefly III (using Docker compose), but if you use environment variables 
  you may have to set this yourself. This is not a mandatory change but will 
  make debugging easier.
- The Docker image is now also available in AArch64.

### Removed
- [skuzzle](https://github.com/skuzzle) removed an annoying console.log statement.

This has been done to simplify the build and make sure your Docker container runs one service, as it should. To set up a cron job for your new Docker container, [check out the documentation](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/en/latest/installation/cronjob.html).
- Due to a change in the database structure, this upgrade will reset your preferences. Sorry about that.
